Make sure you have Python installed and added to your system's PATH variable. You can do this by:

Manual PATH Addition:
If Python is installed but not in PATH, you can add it manually:

Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer'
Click 'Properties'
Click 'Advanced system settings'
Click 'Environment Variables'
Under 'System Variables', find and select 'Path'
Click 'Edit'
Click 'New'
Add the path to your Python installation (typically something like C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x)
Add the path to Python's Scripts folder as well (same path with \Scripts at the end)
Click 'OK' to save



To verify Python is properly installed and in PATH:

Open Command Prompt
Type python --version
If you see a Python version number, everything is set up correctly.
